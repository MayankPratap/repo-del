# repo-del
An easy repository deleter for github ( Under development) .

I wanted to delete many of my repositories on github which I had created or forked but I was not working on them.  

But Github delete option is too time consuming, boring . Isnt it ?? 

So I decided to write a python script which will take all my unwanted repository names through command line and delete them with ease.
