# repo-del
An easy repository deleter for github.

I wanted to delete many of my repositories on github which I had created or forked but I was not working on them.  

But Github delete option is too time consuming, boring. Specially if you have many repositories to delete. Isnt it ?? 

So I decided to write a python script which will take all my unwanted repository names through command line and delete them with ease.

### Works with Python 3. Tested on Ubuntu.

### Steps to run this script

1) First install Google Chrome.

  > sudo apt-get install libxss1 libappindicator1 libindicator7
  > wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
  > sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb
  > sudo apt-get install -f
