# repo-del
An easy repository deleter for github.

I wanted to delete many of my repositories on github which I had created or forked but I was not working on them.  

But Github delete option is too time consuming, boring. Specially if you have many repositories to delete. Isnt it ?? 

So I decided to write a python script which will take all my unwanted repository names through command line and delete them with ease.

### Works with Python 3. Tested on Ubuntu.

### Steps to run this script

1) Clone this repo.

2) To install dependencies :
   
    ```bash
    sh installer.sh
    ```

3) Now, You are ready to go,
  
   ```bash
   python3 raulachrome.py
   ```
